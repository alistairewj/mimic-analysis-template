# Conclusion for reproduction

The following is a logbook/ultimate conclusion for a reproduction of a published scientific study. Feel free to add/remove sections as you find them useful.

## Title

The title of the reproduced study with its digital object identifier (DOI).

## Known differences

Specify changes to the data processing and/or methodology which are known to you. For each difference, describe: (1) the original study approach, (2) the reproduction approach, (3) the justification for the change. If possible, classify the differences as major (could impact the result of the study) or minor (unlikely to change the result of the study).

## Unknown differences

Specify changes to the data processing and/or methodology which *may* have occurred, but you are unable to confirm due to ambiguity in the original material studied. For each difference, describe (1) the most specific reference to the approach in the original study, if possible, and (2) the approach taken in the reproduction.

## Comparison of population

A table comparing the population measures between the original and the reproduction.

Population measure | Original Study | Reproduction

## Comparison of results

A table of the evaluation measures comparing the results in the original study and the reproduction. Also include the final size of the cohort, proportion of individuals excluded, and other important summary measures for the study.

Evaluation measure | Original Study | Reproduction

## Conclusion(s) regarding reproducibility

Highlight specific challenges faced during the reproduction attempt which could be improved upon in the future.
