# Reproducibility guidance

This folder has a set of markdown templates which may be useful in reproducing a published paper in MIMIC.

The anticipated order for use is:

1. STUDY_REVIEW - Review the study in detail to understand the author's approach.
2. PLAN - Plan how the study will be reproduced, making notes of aspects which may change in the reproduction.
3. REPRO_LOG - As you reproduce the code, logging differences is a useful exercise to have a clear explanation for any potential differences in the result.

The EXAMPLE_REPRODUCTION.md document has an example document outlining a reproduction of the arterial line paper.
