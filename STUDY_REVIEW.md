## Study information

### Title

The title of the study with its digital object identifier (DOI).

### Objective(s) of the study

Describe the primary and secondary objectives of the research study.

### Dataset(s) used

Describe the dataset used in the original study. Include:

* Dataset name and version
* DOI (or link if no DOI available)
* Citation
* Other relevant information (link to dataset documentation, etc)

## Summarize the paper

Summarize the paper's goals and results in your own words.

### Strength(s) of the work

Highlight 3 strengths of the work.

### Weakness(es) of the work

Highlight 3 weaknesses of the work.

### Anticipated reproducibility challenges

Describe areas of the paper which appear to lack sufficient detail.

## Data extraction

### Variables

List out the covariates and exposures extracted for the study, e.g. admission source.

### Outcome(s)

List the outcome(s) used in the study, e.g. 28-day mortality.

### Inclusion/Exclusion criteria

Describe the inclusion criteria for the study. Since inclusion/exclusion criteria are interchangeable, decide on the most clear presentation of the study methodology, e.g. "the study included all adults, and excluded patients admitted to CSRU."

### Outlier handling

If outliers were specially processed, describe the approach here.

### Missing data handling

For any missing data present in the study, explain the approach to handle it.

## Results

### Population summary

Provide information about the original study's population: sample size, average mortality, etc. Typically the data is presented in the first table (i.e. Table 1). Select a parsimonious set of descriptors which you will compare your reproduction against. At the very least include the sample size and a summary measure of the outcome(s).

### Analysis method

Explain the analysis method of the study in detail.

### Power calculations (if present)

If a power calculation is present, describe the approach and the assumptions made.

### Evaluation measures

e.g. p-value, effect sizes, statistical tests, performance measures like area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, etc.

### Sensitivity Analyses

Describe any additional sensitivity analyses performed in the study.
